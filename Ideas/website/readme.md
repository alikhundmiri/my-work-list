A list of my ideas


## Fetch the top 5-10 hashtag trends of you local are in Instagram

* Fetch the location of a user
* Using the location, get the top post and most recent posts.
* Analyse the top and most common Hashtags, 

Will be useful for people who market on instagram but cant afford to pay huge amount to big analytical softwares.
this could be a real easy one time payment. 

#### Patyment

This wont be a free service for sure, it has to be a paid one. But I want to price it so low that people would use it every week or so.

So lets say around 10-20 rupees per search.
In used it could be... $.50? if that is even possible.
